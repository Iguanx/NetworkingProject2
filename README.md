Project 2 Creating a Bulletin Board

Current commands worked on:
%connect (prompts for server host and port to connect to)
%join (for part 1 only one message board to join. Prompts for username and checks for originality)
%leave (removes current username from list of active usernames on server)
%exit (Leaves message board if already in it, and disconnects from server.)
%users (Lists all active users on message board)
%identify (gives info about client host and port)

TO RUN:
Run Java server first, then run Python client
Use %connect function, inputting 127.0.0.1 for host and 6789 for port
Try whatever functions you desire and let me know of issues you encounter
